What i have learnt 
-> used useGLTF for 3d model to load and get stored in computer from @react-three/drei
-> Used Suspense from react for the loader
-> OrbitControls from react-three/drei allows us to move the model left and right
-> used primitive tag to show the 3d in the Canvas
-> in primitive scale is used to adjust the size 
where as the position is used to set the position of the 3d model and 
rotation is used to rotate the model upto certain axis
-> the primitive tag works when array of x,y,z is set for scale,position,rotation
-> Canvas tag is used to display the model on html page where
camera position and field of view is set

-> gl is used in canvas from react-three/fiber
